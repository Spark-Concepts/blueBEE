Swap in Bluetooth functionality without a major hardware redesign! The RN42-I/RM is a small form factor, low power Bluetooth radio module offering plug-in compatibility for the widely used 2 x 10 (2mm) socket typically used for XBee radio modules. 
The Roving Networksâ€™ RN42 module provides Bluetooth connectivity in legacy and existing designs that may have been based upon the 802.15.4 standard
